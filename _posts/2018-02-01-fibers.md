Multi-threaded programing can be hard on many levels, and if you are not carful you can end up in some painful situations. I've seen programs that spawn over 60 threads on a quad-core and have each thread hit the same mutex, this isn't performant!






```cpp

void
some_job(job_ctx *ctx, void *arg)
{
  /* do some calculation on the argument */
}


void
job(job_ctx *ctx, void *arg)
{
  int some_data[128];
  job_desc desc[128];

  for(int i = 0; i < 128; ++i)
  {
    desc.func = some_job;
    desc.arg = (void*)some_data[i];
  }

  unsigned batch = job_ctx_submit(ctx, desc, 128);

  job_ctx_wait(ctx, batch);

  /* after all fibers complete we can use the results */
}

```
